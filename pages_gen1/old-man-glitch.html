<h1>What is the Old Man Glitch?</h1>
<p>Named after the Old Man in Viridian City, the Old Man Glitch allows players to encounter any Pokémon! To put it simply, during the catching tutorial, the game temporarily replaces your player name with "Old Man". To make sure your original name isn't lost, the game copies your name to the currently loaded grass encounter table. After the tutorial is over, the game restores your original name. However, the game does NOT clear or initialize the encounter table after the tutorial. The game also does not clear the encounter table if you enter a map that does not have a grass encounter table. Viridian City, Cinnabar Island, and Route 20 do not have a grass encounter table, which makes sense, because neither have any grass tiles. However...</p>

<p>Bodies of water in Kanto usually have these tiles lined up along their western shores. These tiles can be surfed on, and just like other surfable tiles, they may produce a wild encounter if surfed on. However, in regular gameplay, you might have noticed that the Pokémon encountered while surfing on those tiles are not the same ones as the ones that spawn in deeper waters; they are the same as the ones that spawn in nearby patches of grass. Due to a programming error, these tiles encounter Pokémon from the area's grass encounter table rather than the water encounter table.</p>
